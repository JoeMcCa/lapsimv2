V1.0 - 16.10.2021 - JM

Validated vehicle model, plots can be generated using Val_plot.m

Changes made to braking accelerations as simulated values were initially 2x higher than they should have been. 

No noticeable changes to laptime sensitivities.

To change: the sequency in which the track layout is filtered needs to be changed. 
Lat accel does not drop between slaloms because the curvature is filtered after the abs value is taken. this brings the troughs upwards instead of correctly dropping to 0.
